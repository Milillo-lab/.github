## Welcome 👋
The Milillo’s Earth Technology and Analytics Lab (METAL) is a cutting-edge research group at the University of Houston focused on advancing the understanding of Earth's dynamic systems through state-of-the-art remote sensing, geospatial analytics, and machine learning. Led by Prof. Pietro Milillo, METAL develops and applies innovative techniques using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), optical imagery, LiDAR, and topographic data to address critical challenges in environmental monitoring, natural hazard assessment, infrastructure resilience, and climate-driven land surface changes.

METAL fosters interdisciplinary collaborations across academia, government, and industry, with a strong emphasis on actionable science, open data, and training the next generation of Earth scientists and engineers.
